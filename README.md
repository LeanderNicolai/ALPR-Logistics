# Automatic License Plate Recognition for Logistics Automation and Optimization
This is project that focused on the recognition and OCR of European and predominantly German License plates for the automation and optimization of logistics management in warehouses of Small to Medium Enterprises. In short, the project is a combination of the retraining of YOLO, a Deep Learning based Object Detection system, in combination with the Tesseract Library after applying my own pre-processing techniques.


## A demonstration:
Due to GDPR and Privacy Laws it is obviously not possible to show a recording from a public road to show the algorithms capabilities, therefore a small scene from a German Movie was used.
